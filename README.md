# BookBot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

**BookBot** is a Python program that analyzes novels and prints a statistical report of the word and character usage found within.


## What It Does

- Reads a `.txt` file containing a novel or other text
- Counts how often each word appears
- Counts how often each character (letter) appears
- Outputs a sorted, readable report


## How to Clone and Run It

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookbot.git
cd bookbot
```

2. Run the Script
```bash
python main.py <path-to-text-file>
```
